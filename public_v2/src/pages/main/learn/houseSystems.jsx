                  Porphyry is the default house system used at Co–Star. At the
                  time of birth, the precise degree of the sign corresponding
                  with the MC, or Midheaven — aka, where the highest point of
                  the Sun’s path through the sky (the ecliptic) intersects with
                  the meridian — is determined, as is the precise degree of the
                  sign rising on the Eastern Horizon (the Ascendant). The degree
                  of the sign corresponding with the MC marks the cusp of the
                  10th house. The degree of the Ascendant marks the cusp of the
                  1st house. The rest of the space between the MC and the
                  Ascendant is divided into three equal parts.

                  The Descendant and the IC (Imum Coeli, or “bottom of the sky”)
                  are taken to be 180° from (i.e., directly opposite) the
                  Ascendant and the MC, respectively, and the space between them
                  is also divided into three equal parts. Porphyry prioritizes
                  the angles of the chart (the Ascendant, the Descendant, the
                  IC, and the MC) as the 1st, 7th, 4th, and 10th house cusps,
                  respectively, and then determines the other houses from these.
                  Because many people see these four angles as the most powerful
                  parts of the natal chart, they prefer to use the Porphyry
                  system rather than one like Placidus, in which the angles may
                  fall between houses.
